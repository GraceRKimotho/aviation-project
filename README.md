## Aviation Business Analysis

### Overview 
The aim of the project is to conduct analysis for a business looking to diversify its portfolio into the aviation industry. They are particularly interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.

The dataset is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United State International waters.

The presented analysis focuses on key variables such as aircraft make and model, fatalities, time of accidents and accident locations. By addressing missing data, interpreting and visualizing the information, the analysis seeks to offer data-driven insights.

The findings will help the company mitigate potential risks and make informed decisions about aircraft purchases, ensuring a safe and strategic entry into the aviation market.


### Source of data

Main data source is The National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident dataset with information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters. Detailed accidents reports can be accessed on NTSB website.

Initial Dataset: 88889 rows, 31 columns 

Data on accident: Event Id, Investigation Type, Accident Number, Event Date, Location, Country, Latitude, Longitude, Airport Code, Airport Name, Injury Severity, Aircraft Damage, Aircraft Category, Registration Number, Make, Model, Amateur Built, Number Of Engines, Engine Type, FAR Description, Schedule, Purpose Of Flight, Air Carrier, Total Fatal Injuries, Total Serious Injuries, Total Minor Injuries, Total Uninjured, Weather Condition, Broad Phase Of Flight, Report Status, Publication Date.



### Data Understanding and Analysis

In this analysis, we concentrate on business charter flights from the year 2005 onward. This is because the aircraft industry has seen significant advancements, and including older data points could skew the results.
The result of this analysis will be a list of recommended makes and models, determined by calculating accident survival rates.
